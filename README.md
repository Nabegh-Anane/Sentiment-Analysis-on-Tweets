# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

## Description

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using the Twitter API v2 and NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. It collects recent tweets on a specific topic, preprocesses the tweets, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the sentiment distribution using a pie chart.

## Key Features

- **Twitter API v2 Integration**: Collects tweets using Twitter's API v2.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the collected tweets (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Visualization**: Displays a pie chart representing the sentiment distribution.
- **Error Handling**: Handles rate limits and API errors gracefully.

## Advantages

- **Real-Time Data**: Gathers and analyzes live tweets.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple Python script with clear outputs.
- **Customizable**: Modify the query to analyze different topics or hashtags.
- **Insightful Results**: Provides an overview of sentiment trends for a given topic.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `tweepy`
- `pandas`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `python-dotenv`

You can install all the required packages via `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`
```text
tweepy
pandas
nltk
matplotlib
python-dotenv
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nabegh-Anane/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Tweets.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-on-Tweets
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your Twitter Developer credentials:
   - Follow the steps below to get your Twitter API credentials.
   - Create a `.env` file and add your API credentials as follows:
     ```
        CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
        CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
        ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
        ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
        BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
     ```

## Usage

1. After setting up your credentials, run the script:
   ```bash
   python SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.py
   ```

2. The script will collect recent tweets on the topic `"Python programming"`, perform sentiment analysis, and generate a pie chart visualizing the sentiment distribution.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the output will look:

## Future Improvements

- **Expanded Analysis**: Incorporate more advanced sentiment analysis models like BERT or GPT.
- **Data Storage**: Store the collected tweets and sentiment analysis results in a database.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Implement a real-time tracking system for ongoing sentiment analysis.
- **Multilingual Support**: Support for analyzing tweets in multiple languages.

## Common Steps to Get Twitter API Credentials

To get your own Twitter API credentials, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Twitter Developer Account
- Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) and log in with your Twitter account.
- Apply for a developer account if you don't have one. This process includes answering a few questions about how you intend to use the API.

### Step 5: Add Credentials to `.env` File
- After retrieving the credentials (Bearer Token), create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your Bearer Token like this:
  ```
  BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
  ```
